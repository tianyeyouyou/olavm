OlaVM is a STARK-based ZK-friendly ZKVM, it is built on a **small finite field** called [Goldilocks field](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2/blob/main/field/src/goldilocks_field.rs). As the most important component of the Ola system, OlaVM is mainly used to execute a program and generate a valid proof for the **programmable scalable** case and the **programmable private** case.

**Warning: This repository shouldn't be used for production case, as it is still in development phase and has not been audited, so it might contain many bugs and security holes.**.

## Overview

OlaVM is a Turing complete VM, which means that it can execute any computation on it and at the same time it could generate a valid proof for it. For getting a smaller proof time, we have many powerful designs that are relevant with ZK-friendly.

### Key Features

There are a lot of tricks to get a very ZK-friendly ZKVM in OlaVM. We would like to highlight some of them:

- **Algebraic RISC**. The property of the instruction set of OlaVM is Algebraic RISC: "Algebraic" refers to the supported operations are field operation, "RISC" refers to the minimality of the instruction set. We can achieve a concise transition constraint based on this, see [circuit/cpu](https://github.com/Sin7Y/olavm/tree/main/circuits/src/cpu) to learn more;

- **Small finite field**. The word defined in OlaVM is a finite field, [Goldilocks](https://github.com/mir-protocol/plonky2/blob/main/field/src/goldilocks_field.rs). The prime of Goldilocks is p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1, which is less than 64 bits. The computation based on these field elements could be expected to be [much faster]((https://twitter.com/rel_zeta_tech/status/1622984483359129601)) than other large finite fields;

- **Builtins**. Since the cyclic group size is limited, it would be better if the trace table could contain as many transactions as possible. This means that if there are some computation cost a large trace lines in transaction logic, we should remove them from the main trace table and add a special sub-trace table to store them, this is the reason that introduce builtins, like hash, bitwise operation and so on, check the [doc/olavm](https://github.com/Sin7Y/olavm/blob/main/docs/olavm/olavm_sepc.pdf) for more details;

- **Prophets**. It is designed for non-deterministic computation, which means "implementation is expensive, verification is cheap". So to some extent Prophets is more like an external helper. It helps you compute the results of some non-deterministic computation, and then you verify the results using the instruction sets, should note that this verification is done by the VM, not by constraints which is different with builtins, see the [doc/olavm](https://github.com/Sin7Y/olavm/blob/main/docs/olavm/olavm_sepc.pdf) for more details;

## Performance

Many optimizations have not yet been applied, and we expect to see some speed improvements as we devote more time to performance optimization. The benchmarks below should only be used as a rough guide to expected future performance.

Overall, we don't expect the benchmarks to change significantly, but there will definitely be some deviation from the numbers below in the future.
